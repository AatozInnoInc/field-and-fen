# Code Design and QA Standards

Prioritize and observe the following patterns below. Holistically, the codebase must be in compliance with these best practices:

- SOLID
- Repository patterns
- CQRS
- Command patterns
- Factory patterns
- Test-first (this is a test framework)
- Self-documenting code
- Extensive logging throughout the product
- Exception control flow
- SRP
- SOC
- Self-documenting code
- Good variable names
- Consistent formatting
- Consistent structure
- Minimal duplication (DRY)
- Concise error handling
- High-quality testing
- Safeties
- Null guarding
- Exceptional memory management (where applicable) such as memory fencing
- Avoid negative expressions. Check for true/positive checks instead of false/negative checks. Exception: allows for early exits.
